# Lady Bugs!

## Ladybugs Event Id Key
Turns out that we have to key the IDs off of integers or we get an error, so here we go
0: Default
1: Psionic
2: Machine Empire
3: Hive
4: Spiritualist
5: Materialist
6: Xenophile
7: Xenophobe

## ToDos
* Graphics
  * For Discovering the Asteroid
  * For Finishing the Event
  * Splash page for mod upload
* Writing
  * Machine Empires
  * Hive Minds
  * Psionic Empires
* Conditionals
  * Doing these
* Deposits
  * Food + Minerals for Machine Empires
* Coding
  * Get all the text into the yaml files
  * Allow for Conditional Setting of text
  * Allow for conditional reward (machine empires vs every else)
  * Comments for everything
  * Remove Debugging anomaly Stuff
  * Clean up Code Generally after debugging

## Testing
* Need to have the mod set up properly, only known way to do this is to create a mod and then replace the contents of the mod file with this code
* Make sure that the debug versions of the variables are not commented out
* Set your ship to automatically explore until the event is triggered; it should be on the first or second planet


## Explanation

* Okay, having done some research on this, there isn't a way to do inheritance with the events
