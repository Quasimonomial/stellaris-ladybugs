# Default Text

ladybugs.default.desc: "Upon landing on the asteroid, it is clear that it is crawling in what the crew can only describe as Ladybugs. Their habitat extends across much of the asteroid. They are responsive to our scientists, moving away when we approach. But they also move according to other patterns.\n\nThey are capable of flight, like their namesake, but they are unlike the creatures we know. It is becoming clear that they are interacting with beings or substances that we cannot perceive.\n\nWe have seen these creatures falter in mid-flight. Their blood is purple as their shells, and they fall to the rock wounded. Further inspection of these specimens show us that they have suffered biting lacerations, although we did not witness any s life form.\n\nThese Ladybugs are fighting battles of their own and though we did not at first determine their food source, we believe that they are consuming some invisible beasts which sometimes fights back.\n\nBut they are gentle to us. And they leave behind a potent hallucinogen. Our equipment, and the creatures themselves are displaying measurable levels of Zro."
ladybugs.default.option: "We should set up a station to collect the particles from the ladybugs."

# Hive Mind Text

ladybugs.hive.desc: "Despite the observed life forms being very small, deep space ecosystems are so very rare. We sent a self detachment of drones to investigate for signs of life.\n\nWe have been studying the pattern of bug movement; they have near choreographic coordination in their movements with each other, but we believe the bugs are too primitive to form a true coherent overmind.\n\nWe can observe them hunting, but their prey is not obvious. When we observe them “feeding,” we detect radiation in the exotic spectrums; some of the waveforms match those of the shared dream.\n\nThe team spent several sleepcycles deep in the asteroid. After one standard solar rotation, we could no longer feel the thoughts of [Root.GetLeaderName]. Their reports upon rejoining us are… unsettling. They have returned with memories of a splintered dream, fractal centipede biting entities. They have shared hallucinatory memories of wandering aimlessly in the dark, until they reached the surface zones. Here they came into contact with the ladybug swarms, where their bodies were quickly covered in the aliens. Fragmentary memories from the team suggest that the Ladybugs devoured the parasites, but our rover's instruments cannot corroborate this.\n\n[Root.GetLeaderName] is shaken from the experience, but claims certain insights. Their dreams have shown us where we could find accumulated pools of Zro in the asteroid."
ladybugs.hive.option: "Strange developments..."

# Machine Empire Text

ladybugs.machine.desc: "The asteroid displays readings indicating organic lifeforms. These beings have been classified of the type Ladybug due to their similarity to analogous planetbound creatures.\n\nScientists stationed on the [Root.GetName] dispatched a rover to harvest samples of the asteroid for element extraction. The organics are decidedly non hostile, and we were able to perform a thorough mapping of the interior. The Ladybugs show no signs of sentience, and they display flocking behavior that doesn't show any rational purpose, as is common with organics.\n\nOur rover's reading and shipboard sensors have several irreconcilable contradictions; the most reasonable explanation is that some of the mabinoid series metals deep in the asteroid are interfering with our readings.\n\nAll of the samples we have recovered suggest that there are numerous ancient mineral veins here. While there is a low probability that the insect life would interfere with mineral extraction, it is likely that they will be in the way of our equipment."
ladybugs.machine.option: "We must centrifuge the organic matter from our mining operations…"

# Spiritualist Text

ladybugs.spiritualist.desc: "We set down in a cavernous pocket and when we looked out of the portholes, and saw a field of small bright creatures. Their brilliant shells made them look just like Ladybugs.\n\n[Root.GetLeaderName] watched in an awed silence as they fluttered past us with the buzz of a thousand jeweled wings.\n\nThey move in harmony, shifting with currents known only to them. They inhabit this world lightly. Their lives are lived partly in a realm beyond us. A junior researcher swears that he even saw one vanish into thin space, then reappear seconds later, a centipede shape in its mouth. There were no other reports of this sighting, and a sample of this second species has not been recovered.\n\nThere is something else here; there is a malevolence in our dreams, thousands of relentless legs. When we wake, the Ladybugs are with us again, and we can find peace.\n\nWe rise early and watch them. Sometimes, they land on our hands so gently we almost cannot perceive them. After they flit away, we find golden dust resting in our palms, which we identified as Zro. The creatures are coated in it, carrying it on their own wings and legs."
ladybugs.spiritualist.option: "It is transcendent!"

# Materialist Text

ladybugs.materialist.desc: "Our scientists report that the asteroid is covered in inch long, round beetles with bright purple shells and tiny black spots. The insects exhibit social behavior but do not appear to be eusocial.\n\nThese beetles display predatory instinct, leaping and chewing with their jaws, but no prey can be observed. The subjects engage in this behavior most frequently at the mouth of various lattice-like micro tunnels throughout the interior of the rock.\n\nThe occurrence of Zro dust on these insects should be a topic of further research. The present study included a sampling of this dust. Our study's methodology involved sterilizing the living subjects of this material and observing them within a sealed chamber. Within a period of 3 metric hours, our data indicate that the dust density returned to standard ambient levels.\n\nThe origin of the dust on these insects is unknown, but setting up an observation post would allow us to find more dust, and possibly answers."
ladybugs.materialist.option: "Acknowledged."

# Xenophile Text

ladybugs.xenophile.desc: "After a long journey in space, we have found something charming. Rather than bare, lifeless rock, this asteroid is host to a colony of small and peaceful bugs.\n\nWe watched with delight as these insects rose from the ground and settled on our scientists and our ship immediately after we set foot on the surface of the asteroid.\n\nThese are lively creatures, persevering cheerfully in this inhospitable location. We believe they cannot be native to this environment, as they do not seem to be adapted originally for the demands of deep space.\n\nThey have a food source here, and we can note that they are eating beings invisible to the human eye, but it is a precarious existence. We have encountered injured Ladybugs although there is no visible predator here, and we know they are not aggressive with each other.\n\nWe find these amazing beings are producing remarkable quantities of Zro which coats their bodies. We theorize that this substance could be healing them from the injuries they receive from their invisible adversaries. After handling them, our scientists find Zro dust in their pockets and the folds of their clothes.\n\nOur scientists are attempting to bring some of these Ladybugs aboard with us, so we can take them home."
ladybugs.xenophile.option: "Awww, they're cute!"

# Xenophobe Text

ladybugs.xenophobe.desc: "The crew of the [Root.GetName] immediately encountered a writhing mass on the asteroid's rock.  The surface of the stellar body is roiling with insectoid creatures crawling up from the cracks and crevices, but thankfully they seem to ignore or avoid our scientists. Despite the reservations of the crew, the observation station has been set up, and our drones have patrolled the interior of the asteroid.\n\nThe insects appear to be large, aggressive scarab-like beetles with carnivorous mandibles.\n\nBy observing video of the alien bugs viciously attacking what appears to be empty vacuum, we theorize that they could be hunting some other life form; something invisible, perhaps worse.\n\nEach bug has in its possession a small quantity of Zro; a fringe theory on the team suggests that the beasts have stolen it from their environment to aid in hunting, perhaps tracking physionic emissions from their prey.\n\nWe could set up a mining station here, using centrifuges to extract Zro from a paste made from the aliens."
ladybugs.xenophobe.option: "Distressing, but useful."
