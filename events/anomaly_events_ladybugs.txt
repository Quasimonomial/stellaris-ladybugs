The object appears to be placed by an ancient civilization, roughly 3000 years ago. In their culture, placing flags on celestial objects was a way to claim areas in space. \n\nSince there is little to no wind on §Y[From.GetName]§!, the flag has not eroded over the past 3000 years. What happened to the ancient civilization is still a mystery. "
