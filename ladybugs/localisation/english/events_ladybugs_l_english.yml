# Default Text

ladybug_asteroid_category_desc.default: "We have detected small fluttering life forms on the surface of this asteroid.  They seem to be glistening with light outside the visible spectrum."
ladybugs.default.desc: "Upon landing on the asteroid, it is clear that it is crawling in what the crew can only describe as Ladybugs. Their habitat extends across much of the asteroid. They are responsive to our scientists, moving away when we approach. But they also move according to other patterns.\n\nThey are capable of flight, like their namesake, but they are unlike the creatures we know. It is becoming clear that they are interacting with beings or substances that we cannot perceive.\n\nWe have seen these creatures falter in mid-flight. Their blood is purple as their shells, and they fall to the rock wounded. Further inspection of these specimens show us that they have suffered biting lacerations, although we did not witness any other life form.\n\nThese Ladybugs are fighting battles of their own  and though we did not at first determine their food source, we believe that they are consuming some invisible beasts which sometimes fights back.\n\nBut they are gentle to us. And they leave behind a potent hallucinogen. Our equipment, and the creatures themselves are displaying measurable levels of Zro."
ladybugs.default.option: "We should set up a station to collect the particles from the ladybugs."

ladybug_asteroid_category_desc.materialist: "There appear to be insect life forms on this planet.  While they exhibit predation behaviors, we can detect no viable food source."
ladybugs.materialist.desc: "Our scientists report that the asteroid is covered in inch long, round beetles with bright purple shells and tiny black spots.  The insects exhibit social behavior but do not appear to be eusocial.\n\nThe insects exhibit predatory instinct, leaping and chewing with their jaws, but no prey can be observed; they do this most when at the mouth of various lattice like micro tunnels throughout the interior of the rock.\n\nOf interest to us is that their legs and shells appear to be coated in fine Zro dust; we removed the dust from several specimens and kept them in a containment chamber, but within hours the dust density had returned to ambient levels.\n\nThe continuous origin of the dust on these insects is unknown, but setting up an observation post would allow us to find more dust, and possibly answers."
ladybugs.materialist.option: "Acknowledged."
