ladybugs.1.name: "Ladybugs?"
ladybugs.1.desc: "Upon landing on the asteroid, it is clear that it is crawling in what the crew can only describe as Ladybugs.\n\nTheir habitat extends across much of the asteroid. They are responsive to our scientists, moving away when we approach. But they also move according to other patterns.
They are capable of flight, like their namesake, but they are unlike the creatures we know. It is becoming clear that they are interacting with beings or substances that we cannot perceive.\n\nWe have seen these creatures falter in mid-flight. Their blood is purple as their shells, and they fall to the rock wounded. Further inspection of these specimens show us that they have suffered biting lacerations, although we did not witness any other life form.\n\nThese Ladybugs are fighting battles of their own  and though we did not at first determine their food source, we believe that they are consuming some invisible beasts which sometimes fights back.\n\nBut they are gentle to us. And they leave behind a potent hallucinogen. Our equipment, and the creatures themselves are displaying measurable levels of Zro."
